# Farmer_Pond
Based on Farming Essentials water plays crucial role in farming 
so our Project is build to check the quality of water with respect to 2 main factor
pH of Water  &  TDS of water

pH is standardised as 
if pH is < 7 then water is Acidic
if pH is =7 then water is Neutral
if pH is >7 then water is Alkaline

TDS is standardised as 
if TDS is around 50 - 100 = water is Good little pollutants
if TDS is around 200 - 400
